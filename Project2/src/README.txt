How to compile and run program: if running from a command line, compile using "javac Game.java" from inside 'src' folder and run the Game file using "java Game"
                                if running from IntelliJ, run the main method in the 'Game.java' class

Assumptions: assume that the user clicks enter after every input when prompt

Known bugs: if multiple inputs are entered in one line then it may skip error messages or prompted questions
